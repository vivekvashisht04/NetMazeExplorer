# Simulating Network Scenarios

This directory contains screenshots related to the performance and security testing phase of the **NetMaze Explorer** project, specifically focusing on simulating network scenarios. The images document the steps taken to simulate various network conditions to ensure the robustness and reliability of the network architecture.

These scenarios are critical for validating the network's behavior under different conditions, such as high traffic, security breaches, or connectivity issues. By simulating these situations, I was able to assess and optimize the networkâ€™s performance, ensuring it meets the required standards for security and efficiency.
