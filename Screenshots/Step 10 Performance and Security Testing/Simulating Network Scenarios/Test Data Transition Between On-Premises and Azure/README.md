# Test Data Transition Between On-Premises and Azure

This directory contains screenshots related to testing the data transition between on-premises environments and Azure in the **NetMaze Explorer** project. This test was focused on verifying the secure and efficient transfer of data between these environments as part of the simulated network scenarios.

The images in this folder document the steps taken to validate that data can be seamlessly and securely transferred between the on-premises and Azure environments. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the network configurations in supporting data transition, ensuring both security and performance are maintained throughout the process.
