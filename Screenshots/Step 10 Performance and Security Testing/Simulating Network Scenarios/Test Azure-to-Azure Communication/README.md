# Test Azure-to-Azure Communication

This directory contains screenshots related to testing Azure-to-Azure communication in the **NetMaze Explorer** project. This test was focused on verifying the network connectivity and communication between different Azure virtual machines (VMs) within the same Azure environment.

In addition to testing connectivity, the test also involved validating the data transfer process between these Azure VMs. The images in this folder document both the communication pathways and the successful data transfer operations, ensuring that the network configurations support secure, reliable interactions, and efficient data exchange between Azure-based resources. The results confirm that the communication and data transfer between Azure VMs are functioning as expected, enabling seamless operations across the Azure environment.
