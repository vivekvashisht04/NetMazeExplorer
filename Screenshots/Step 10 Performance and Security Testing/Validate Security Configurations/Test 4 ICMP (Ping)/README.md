# Test 4: ICMP (Ping)

This directory contains screenshots related to the fourth test conducted during the validation of security configurations in the **NetMaze Explorer** project. This test was focused on checking connectivity between simulated on-premises and Azure VMs, as well as between Azure VMs.

The images in this folder document the process of sending ICMP (Ping) requests to verify network connectivity between these environments. The results demonstrate how the network configurations allow or restrict ICMP traffic, ensuring secure and reliable communication between the simulated on-premises and Azure environments.
