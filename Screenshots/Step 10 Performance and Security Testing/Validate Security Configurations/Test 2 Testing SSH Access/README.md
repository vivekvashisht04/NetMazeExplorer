# Test 2: Testing SSH Access to DatabaseVM from Authorized and Unauthorized Sources

This directory contains screenshots related to the second test conducted during the validation of security configurations in the **NetMaze Explorer** project. This test focuses on verifying SSH access controls to the `DatabaseVM` by testing connections from both authorized and unauthorized sources.

The images in this folder document the process of testing SSH access, demonstrating the effectiveness of the implemented security rules. The results show whether the SSH access control configurations are correctly allowing access to authorized sources while denying access to unauthorized sources.
