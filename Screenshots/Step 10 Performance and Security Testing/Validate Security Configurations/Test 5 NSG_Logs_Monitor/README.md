# Test 5: NSG Logs Monitor

This directory contains screenshots related to the fifth test conducted during the validation of security configurations in the **NetMaze Explorer** project. This test focused on monitoring Network Security Group (NSG) logs to verify the effectiveness of security rules, particularly those blocking unauthorized HTTP access to the WebAppVM.

The images document the process of configuring NSG flow logs, testing unauthorized access, and verifying the results in the logs, confirming that the security rules were applied and functioned correctly.
